This code will display an output on screen:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hello World");

Console.Write("Hello");
Console.Write("");
Console.Write("World!";
```

When a phrase is surrounded by double-quotations, it is called a **literal string.** 

# How it works.

The `WriteLine()` part is called a **method**. Methods always have a parenthesis after them.

The `Console` part is called a **class**. Methods live inside of a class. 

There is also a dot `.` which separates the class name `Console` and the method `WriteLine`. The dot is a *member access operator*. This is how you navigate from a class to a method.

There is a semi-colon `;` which is the *end of statement operator*. A **statement** is a complete instruction in C#. The semi-colon tells the compiler that the command is complete.
